                Make Dua was created to provide a beautiful, accessible collection of Islamic duas (supplications) for Muslims around the world. Our mission is to make it easier for Muslims to find and recite appropriate duas for every situation in their lives, as well as to facilitate a community of believers supporting each other through prayer.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Dua (supplication) is the essence of worship in Islam. It is a direct conversation with Allah, where we express our needs, hopes, fears, and gratitude. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) made dua for all aspects of his life and taught us to do the same.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In Islam, making dua for your fellow Muslims is highly encouraged. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us that when a Muslim makes dua for another Muslim in their absence, an angel is appointed who says "Ameen, and the same for you" after each dua.

                Our "Request Dua" feature allows Muslims to anonymously share their needs with the community and receive the spiritual support of prayers from around the world.
